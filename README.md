# Sorting-Algorithms
Here on this repository I am going to show all the sorting algorithms made with python.

But what are sorting algorithms? Sorting algorithms are algorithms created to sort a set of datas either in ascending order or not. For example, we have an array of unsorted numbers: [7, 3, 9, 8, 10, 6, 2, 1]. Now this same array sorted: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

Of course, there are several ways of make sorting algorithms, therefore, I aim with this repository show those algorithms for sorting from short arrays to huge ones.
